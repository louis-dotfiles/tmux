# Tmux configuration README

This is my configuration for the [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) terminal multiplexer.


## Installation

All you have to do is clone this repository in `~/.config/tmux`,
i.e. [~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf](~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf) should be
[this file](./tmux.conf). Symlinking is also a popular option.

Also install the [Tmux plugin manager aka TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm).
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.config/tmux/plugins/tpm
```

And in Tmux use `prefix + I` to install the plugins.
